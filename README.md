This is a school project that I made when I first learned Java programming. 
The game is played through a command line.

How to run:
  1. copy files
  2. to play with two real players, type "make run"
  3. to play with one real player and 1 AI player, type "make runAI"

Notes:
As mentioned, this was a class project. The skeletons of these files were handed out
by my professor, Dr. Schwesinger, and then updated and edited by myself.

The AI for this game could be improved quite a bit. This project was made to include
a very simple bot player as it was not the main focus.

To run JavaDoc, type "make doc". The documentation will then be stored in a directory called "doc".
A few errors will display when running this command because some things are not commented.

To build the .class files, type "make build".

To remove the .class files, type "make clean".
