This is a school project that I made when I first learned Java programming. 
The game is played through a command line.

How to run:
  1. copy files
  2. to play with two real players, type "make run"
  3. to play with one real player and 1 AI player, type "make runAI"

Notes:

The AI for this game could be improved quite a bit. This project was made to include
a very simple bot player as it was not the main focus.

To run JavaDoc, type "make doc". The documentation will then be stored in a directory called "doc".
A few errors will display when running this command because some things are not commented.

To build the .class files, type "make build".

To remove the .class files, type "make clean".
